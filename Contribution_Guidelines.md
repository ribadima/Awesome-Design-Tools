# Contribution Guidelines
If you would like to contribute, just send a Pull Request. Please:
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one to prevent duplicates. 
* Put the tool in the alphabetical order. All tools are great, so we want to treat them equally.
* Try to make your Pull Request descriptive.
* New categories are welcomed, if you have 2+ tools to submit to that category.
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period and remove trailing whitespace.
* Check spelling and grammar.

## Link Format
* Please, use the following format for the links in Pull Requests: ``[Tool](link) â€” description``.

* Please, add the appropriate labels:
  * ![free.svg](https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Awesome-Design-Tools/blob/master/Media/free.svg) for free tools (entirely free tools, not freemium). Just copy & paste the following snippet: ``![free.svg](https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Awesome-Design-Tools/blob/master/Media/free.svg)``
  * ![open-source.svg](https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Awesome-Design-Tools/blob/master/Media/open-source.svg) for open-source tools. Use the following snippet: ``![open-source.svg](https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Awesome-Design-Tools/blob/master/Media/open-source.svg)``
  * ![mac.svg](https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Awesome-Design-Tools/blob/master/Media/mac.svg) for Mac only tools. Use the following snippet: ``![mac.svg](https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Awesome-Design-Tools/blob/master/Media/mac.svg)``
  
## Review Workflow  
We will do our best to review your submission as soon as we can. Please, consider that we have a full-time job in our startup :) Your contribution might be rejected if the tool didn't pass our curation. Of course, this is very subjective and if you think we are being unfair, do let us know.
